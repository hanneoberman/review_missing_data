# Introduction

- missing data is problematic and inevitable when working with RWD in a clinical setting

- there has been a shift from CCA to stats to ML methods to handle missing data

- ML methods appear to be better suited for empirical data, where assumptions of CCA and stats methods do not hold

- this review aims to summarize simulation studies into missing data methods

# Methods

- AI assisted reviewing, see Nature publication ASReview

- literature search PubMed and ArXiv with inclusion criteria: missing/incomplete, simulation, ...

- manual selection of 15 relevant articles for stopping criterion AI assisted reviewing

- removed duplicates, start screening abstracts selected by ASReview

- stop screening when 15 manually selected articles are 'found' by ASReview

- screen full articles with inclusion criteria: missingness empirical/MAR/MNAR (not MCAR), ...
